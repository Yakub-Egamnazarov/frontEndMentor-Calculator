- Using semantic elements to avoid accessibility issues (main, header, footer), role attribution to describe the role of the screen readers. [link here](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/region?application=axeAPI)
- Instead of putting the theme class to the HTML tag give it to the body tag, it works too.
- If you want to use input for the toggle you should use label too, but the 'UL'-unordered list tag with some of the CSS will get the job done too
- If you could render the sum it will be very good so the user can see the whole sum.
- **BUG** The app didn't make the calculation when I click on the equal button if it's not correct so if you can handle this to show an error 'Syntax error' to the user when it happens it will be great.
