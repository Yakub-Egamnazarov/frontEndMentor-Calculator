## Overview

By performing this challenge I acquired js+css+html skill. I completed this challenge in vanilla JS, so no other frameworks used. Though in the future I'm planning to complete this challenge in React.
As a bonus I learned how to created a theme toggler switch, and to use global CSS variables, and how it is convenient to switch them by just few lines of JS code.
The challenge is made totally responsive according the requirements. Where the breakpoints considered as 600px, since it satisfies the lower px screens as well

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
